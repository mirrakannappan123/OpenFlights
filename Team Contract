Communication Team Meetings : All team meetings will be in person at 4th floor grainger every week for 1-2 hours on Wednesday. We will not be recording our meetings. 

Assistance : We will be contacting each other through text messages. We will be expected to respond to each other by the end of the day. 

Respect : We will make sure all team members are able to voice their opinions when discussing project ideas. We must come to a full agreement on ideas related to the project. 

Collaboration Work Distribution : We will split up the workload based on our goals and each of our strengths for each week. We will make sure each group member has a part to work on for the project. We will come together and discuss any unexpected complications. If needed, we will contact our mentor.

Time Commitment : Each team member must spend at minimum 3 to 4 hours a week on their assigned task or up unitl that task is completed. If a team member is unable to commit time to complete thier task they must let the other team members know and complete it by the next week. If conflicts do arise, we will come to a conclusion as a group and move deadlines as needed.

Conflict Resolution: Our team will resolve situations where there is a disagreement by talking it out and coming to a middle ground. We will give members a few warnings if they have not accomplished their tasks. Although, if this behavior continues, we will address the problem with our mentor. We will address members being late with the same process. No, there are no other hypothetical situations that we want to discuss ahead of time.
